## What is Advizot Meetings?

#### Let's face it: that overly huge, pen-and-paper sign-in sheet at every Vistage meeting is less than ideal. It's hard to read people's writing, and during the meeting it is almost impossible to see it from across a room. Enter **Advizot Meetings**.

<p>The questions and answers that are usually at the top of the sign-in sheets are presented as a submittable form for members to fill out. From there, each member's form submissions are displayed on each member's personal device as well as a projector at the front of the room, completely eliminating the need for a pen-and-paper sign-in sheet!</p>

<p>Additionally, with the user's permission, Advizot Meetings synchronizes the user's form inputs with their Coach Accountable app thanks to an integration with its API, allowing each set of answers to be accessed with their chair during 1:1s and kept track of over time to easily assess progress toward goals, as well as trends in overall wellbeing!</p>
